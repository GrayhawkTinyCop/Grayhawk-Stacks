# Forgotten Crypt Pt.1

After some lighthearted moments, the party arrived in Menmar and entered a dungeon to eliminate hostile creatures. They quickly encountered and defeated a group of skeletons. Inside, they rescued a scared girl named Sonia and discovered ancient texts revealing a wizard practicing necromancy. Continuing their exploration, they swiftly dispatched a larger undead creature. Finally, they found a feisty young boy named Jonah, whose bravery Remo agreed to report to the village, despite the boy's insults.
