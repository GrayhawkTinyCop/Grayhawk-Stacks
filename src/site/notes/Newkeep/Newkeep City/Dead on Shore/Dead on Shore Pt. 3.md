# Dead on Shore Pt. 3

The party met with Jarred the Merchant and were introduced to Kingfisher, who would be joining their expedition to eliminate the river monsters. They decided to walk towards the river, and as they approached, Kingfisher began making frog-like sounds. This immediately caused a nearby Neovik to be swarmed by frogs. While the party was dealing with the sudden frog attack, a large toad emerged from the water and landed in their midst. The toad managed to knock down Viggi by swinging Neovik as a bludgeon. Fortunately, Silas swiftly dispatched the creature with a well-aimed arrow to the head.

Following a trail of shell fragments down a tributary, the party arrived at some ruins where they spotted two "Toad Turtles" in the distance. They prepared themselves for another encounter. The "Toad Turtles" quickly jumped towards the party, and after a fierce exchange of attacks, they managed to defeat one of the monstrous creatures. However, the second "Toad Turtle" managed to escape into the underground river.

As the party caught their breath after the intense fight, they noticed something moving in the water, heading directly towards them. A terrifying monstrosity emerged from the depths and launched an attack. Despite their efforts, three of the five party members were soon on the brink of death, caught in the creature's tentacles, while another struggled to escape. Silas managed to injure the tentacle monster, causing it to launch the four ensnared party members as projectiles towards him before retreating back into the depths from which it came.

After gathering themselves and the shell fragments they had collected, the party returned to Jarred the Merchant. They presented him with the shells and recounted their harrowing experiences with the river's dangerous inhabitants.
