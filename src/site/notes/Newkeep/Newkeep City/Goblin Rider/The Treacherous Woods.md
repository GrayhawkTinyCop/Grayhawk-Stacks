#  The Treacherous Woods

Following a map from previous goblins, Gimli led the way, but the group soon encountered traps that inflicted minor injuries on Arcwright and Looper. Attempting to bypass further traps by traversing a cliff edge, Gimli carried the weakened Looper, inadvertently alerting goblins hiding in a tree. A challenging fight ensued, resulting in Arcwright being incapacitated. Some smaller goblins fled and were executed by a disappointed major boss who spoke Common. This display caused a minor boss to act erratically and stumble into his own minion's trap. After a hard-fought victory against the remaining enemies, Gimli and Looper discovered a magical scroll revealing a map with a castle-like symbol, hinting at a future investigation.
