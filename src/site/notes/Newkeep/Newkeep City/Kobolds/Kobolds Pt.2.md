# Kobolds Pt.2

Responding to reports of Kobold attacks on merchants, our party tracked the culprits to their cave hideout and systematically engaged them. Despite the Kobolds' surprising organization, better equipment on some, and the use of tamed wolves, we were making progress until a large, draconic quadruped erupted from the ground and attacked us with stored fire. After a challenging battle, we managed to defeat the creature, but having sustained injuries, we quickly gathered some recovered stolen goods and retreated from the cave, taking a scale from the draconic beast in hopes of identifying it later.
