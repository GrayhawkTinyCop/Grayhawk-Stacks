After introducing themselves to one another, the party embarked on their mission to retrieve supplies that had been stolen by Kobolds. Their journey along the road led them to a clearing where they encountered wild sheep or rams grazing peacefully. Further down the road, they discovered a ransacked cart, clearly indicating the Kobolds' passage. Footprints and a trail of scattered supplies pointed the way towards a nearby cave.

Following the trail, the party entered the cave, where they found the Kobold culprits.

With the goods recovered, the party returned them to the grateful merchants, completing their task.
