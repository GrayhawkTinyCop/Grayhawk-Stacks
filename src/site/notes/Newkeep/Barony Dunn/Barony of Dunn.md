# Village Dunn  

Situated along the road to Newkeep, Dunn is a quiet village known for its role as a diplomatic crossroads. Baroness Jende Sallud-Bovey, a respected human noble, rules from her modest mansion, balancing the interests of Pelsand with those of the Grey Elves of Rieuwood. Dunn is a peaceful settlement, surrounded by farmland, but recent troubles have stirred unease among the villagers.   The village square is a hub of activity, hosting seasonal festivals like the Growfest, while the Feast of Edoria is celebrated in honor of the region’s agricultural roots.  
  
The Leaf and Lantern, a cozy tavern, serves as a gathering spot for travelers and locals alike, where tales of the mysterious creatures in the Speckled Woods are whispered over hearty meals.  
  
Though quiet, Dunn holds a strategic position and has recently seen an influx of refugees seeking safety within its palisades. The town’s air of tranquility hides a growing tension as strange happenings begin to encroach upon its borders.
