Having been hired by the promising merchant Jarett as escorts on his ship to Faw's Luck, we embarked on a journey where we met the crew and experienced an "accidental" ship damaging incident. The river itself was disturbingly empty of small fish and littered with destroyed vessels. Our journey involved successfully fighting off two enormous catfishes before encountering a river monster, which we managed to drive away through teamwork. Ultimately, we completed our escort mission, marking the beginning of what promises to be a series of adventures with our newfound companions.
