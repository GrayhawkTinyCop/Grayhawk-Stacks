# County of Pelsand:  

The County of Pelsand is a strategically vital region in Sunndi, with its southwestern border defended by the rugged Hollow Highlands, whose steep passes serve as key routes to neighboring Idee. The county is rich in natural resources, with dense forests in the central and northeastern areas providing timber, game, and cover for military movements. The Pawluck River, originating in the highlands, flows north-south through Pelsand, creating fertile agricultural lands along its banks. These lands produce abundant crops that sustain both the local population and the military forces stationed in the capital, Newkeep, ensuring the county's resilience and self-sufficiency.
